                    <p>Possessing the fundamentals of logic, problem-solving and programming language structure provides a solid foundation for further study in the field. Students develop introductory knowledge of computer programming with emphasis on problem analysis and design, using algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and testing, with the Java programming language used as a means to implement problem solution designs. Through an introduction to the Java programming language students use sequential structures, selection structures, repetition structures, variables, constants, methods, constructors, one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming, classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, inputs, outputs, coding conventions and documentation. Theory is reinforced with application by means of practical laboratory assessments.

                    <p>The study of algebraic and transcendental functions is an essential prerequisite to Calculus. Students manipulate algebraic expressions, solve algebraic equations and linear systems and learn the properties of and graph algebraic and transcendental functions. Students investigate computer number systems in addition to Boolean algebra and logic to help solve problems involving computer systems. Students also study the addition and subtraction of vectors using vector components. Delivered in a modular format, this course is equivalent to the completion of all of the following math modules MAT8100 - A, B, C, D, E, F, and L.
